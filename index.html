        <h3>Mathematical formulas</h3>

        <strong>Linear Equations</strong>

        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

        <p class="code"><span>ax + b = 0</span></p>

        <p>where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are real numbers and <i>x</i> is a variable. This 
            form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear 
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start 
            off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be 
            an <i>x</i> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an x there.
        </p>

        <strong> Quadratic Equation</strong>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

        <p class="code"><span>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>

        <p>where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> are known values 
           and <i>x</i> is the variable or unknown (we don't know 
           it yet). Also, <i>a</i> can't be 0.</p>

        <strong>The area of a circle (A)</strong>

        <p><i>&pi;</i> (Pi) times the radius (<i>r</i>) squared:</p>

        <p class="code"><span>A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>

        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<i>D</i>):</p>
        
        <p class="code"><span>A = &pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span></p>

        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<i>C</i>):</p>

        <p class="code"><span>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span></p>

        <p><strong>Intersection</strong></p>

        <p>The intersection of two sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, 
           denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members 
           of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

        <p class="code"><span>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span></p>

        <p>That is, <i>x</i> is an element of the intersection A &cap; 
           B if and only if <i>x</i> is both an element of <i>A</i> 
           and an element of <i>B</i>.</p>
